    <h1>1) Google Summer of Code</h1>
    <p>The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards
        stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer.
        The program is open to university students aged 18 or over. It was first held from May to August 2005. The
        amount of the stipend depends on the purchasing power parity of the country where the student's university is
        located. Project ideas are listed by host organizations involved in open-source software development, though
        students can also propose their own project ideas.</p>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Open-source organizations apply to participate</li>
        <li>. If accepted, each organization provides a list of initial project ideas and invites students to their
            development communities.</li>
        <li>Students who meet the eligibility criteria then submit up to 3 proposals that detail the software-coding
            projects that interest them. These applications are then evaluated by the corresponding mentoring
            organization, with mentors and organizational administrators reviewing the applications and deciding how
            many "slots" to request from Google and which proposals to accept. </li>
        <li> Google allocates slots to each organization, taking into account organizational capacity, mentoring
            history, and the number of applications the organization has received. Finally, organizations select top
            proposals to fill their slots and Google verifies eligibility before announcing accepted students. </li>
    </ul>
