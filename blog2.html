    <h1>1) Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p> Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its
        environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the
        term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive"
        functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>

    <p>Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of
        computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as
        well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.</p>

    <p>The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors,
        software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and
        systems over the Internet.</p>
